            <p>The world is becoming more interconnected, yet geographical knowledge 
                and cultural awareness often remain limited, particularly amongst 
                younger generations. This disparity became our focal point as we 
                endeavored to devise a solution that would be both engaging and 
                educational for children. Our target users are children aged between 
                6-9 years old, primarily residing in urban areas, with access to educational 
                resources and digital devices.</p>
            <img src = "image/VisitAR/illustration-1.png" alt = "A tangible map going with the game"></image>
            <p>We chose to focus on the amalgamation of augmented reality (AR) technology 
                and tangible toys to create an immersive, interactive, and educational game. 
                This game aims to enhance children's understanding of geography and foster 
                cultural awareness. We selected this approach based on extensive research 
                and observations, which indicated that children often learn better when they 
                can interact physically with the learning materials.</p>
            <img src = "image/VisitAR/illustration-2.png" alt = "Tangible postcard design">
            <p>Our final product is an innovative blend of tangible toys and augmented reality (AR), 
                designed to create an immersive, interactive, and educational experience that enhances 
                geographical knowledge and cultural awareness in children aged between 6-9 years old. 
                The AR-enabled game uses a global map, along with a set of tangible mini-games, each 
                associated with a specific country.</p>
