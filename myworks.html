                        Hi, I'm Viet Tran. I'm a student, UX designer and a digital media artist. I love utilizing the digital platform to create unlimited artworks and businesses. Besides, I'm also interested in entrepreneurships and investments. What I care most in every design is the sustainability, the impact on human health and behavior, and its accessibility. With my experiences, I'm more than excited to work with you in a variety of fields.

                    <p>
                        I also like to travel around and meeting new mindsets!

                        <p>Photography is the way I tell my stories. It is also the way I can remember the moments, the people, the selves that I used to be. I like both the digital photography and the more conventional way of taking photos (film photography). Each has its own beaty and I hope you see why in my gallery. Please enjoy! </p>
