                <h2>Urbanized Loneliness</h2>
            </div>
            <p>The idea of the series is inspired by the function of photography to trigger the nostalgic feeling. 
                At the same time, I am curious about the state of loneliness that each of us is going through. 
                “Ways of Seeing” of John Berger also alters the way I capture the photos in order to get the meaning 
                I want to send. The main idea these photos try to convey is to highlight the loneliness of 
                the people living in the industrialization era. Shanghai is a perfect destination since it 
                is a modern and convenient city. This allows people in the city to live more comfortable but 
                simultaneously more separated because of the high pace living. The photo order goes from the 
                broad view to the details of the city. Each of the photo will have a different feeling that 
                related to the keyword “loneliness”. Through the series, I want people to engage the loneliness 
                with their understanding and have their own conclusion about the definition of “the urbanized loneliness”. </p>
